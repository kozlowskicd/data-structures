# Tree

[View Full List of Data Structures](../README.md)

## Challenge
Using node objects, create a tree class object that has the functionality sort the containing values, add values, and search for a given value.

## Approach & Efficiency
Both `tree.js` and `binary-search-tree.js` make use of Node class objects that have variables to reference a value, a left node, and a right node.  The Tree class objects have a constructor that build a tree with a root node of a given value.
